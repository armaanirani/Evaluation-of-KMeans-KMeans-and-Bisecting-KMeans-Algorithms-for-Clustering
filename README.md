This project involves implementing and evaluating three clustering algorithms: KMeans, KMeans++, and Bisecting KMeans. The goal is to understand their performance on a given dataset by varying the number of clusters and computing the Silhouette coefficient. Additionally, synthetic data will be generated to further analyze the KMeans algorithm. The project includes plotting results, calculating evaluation metrics, and comparing the clustering outcomes to provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm.
